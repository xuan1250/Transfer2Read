# SSL Certificates Directory

This directory will contain your SSL certificates after running certbot.

**Files (created during setup):**
- fullchain.pem - Full certificate chain
- privkey.pem - Private key

**Important:**
- Never commit SSL certificates to git
- Keep privkey.pem secure (chmod 600)
- Certificates expire every 90 days (Let's Encrypt)

See nginx/README.md for setup instructions.
