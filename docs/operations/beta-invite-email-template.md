Hi [Name],

Thank you for signing up to beta test Transfer2Read!

**What is Transfer2Read?**

Transfer2Read is a PDF-to-EPUB conversion tool designed specifically for e-reader users who want to read technical books, textbooks, and complex documents on their favorite devices (Apple Books, Kindle, Kobo). Unlike generic converters, we use AI to intelligently preserve formatting, equations, tables, and images—delivering an EPUB that actually looks good on your e-reader.

**What we need from you:**

We're looking for honest feedback on your conversion experience. Specifically:

1. **Test 2-3 PDFs** from your personal collection:
   - Try a mix: simple text-heavy PDFs and complex ones (equations, tables, images)
   - Upload to [https://transfer2read.com](https://transfer2read.com)
   - Download the EPUB and open it on your e-reader

2. **Provide feedback** on:
   - Conversion quality: Did the EPUB look good? Any formatting issues?
   - Ease of use: Was the upload/download process straightforward?
   - Performance: How long did conversions take? Any errors?
   - Missing features: What would make Transfer2Read more useful for you?

3. **Report bugs** (if you encounter any):
   - Screenshot the issue (if visual)
   - Share the original PDF (if comfortable) so we can reproduce
   - Submit via feedback form: [FEEDBACK_FORM_LINK] (or reply to this email)

**Timeline:**

- Beta testing window: **1 week** (from [START_DATE] to [END_DATE])
- Please complete your testing by [END_DATE]
- We'll send a reminder halfway through the week

**Getting Started:**

1. Visit [https://transfer2read.com](https://transfer2read.com)
2. Register with this email: **[USER_EMAIL]**
3. Upload a PDF (max 50MB for beta)
4. Download your EPUB and test it on your e-reader
5. Fill out feedback form: [FEEDBACK_FORM_LINK]

**What's in it for you?**
