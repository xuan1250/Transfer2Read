ribe, 2025]

**Specific Issues:**
- **"Messed up layouts"** become **"gibberish"** and **"unusable"** [Quora, Reddit]

- **Multi-Language Documents:** Mixed scripts (e.g., English + Japanese) pose conversion challenges
- **Scanned PDFs:** OCR quality varies wildly; some converters embed PDFs as images (defeating the purpose) [Reddit]

**Quote:** *"Calibre may struggle with sophisticated PDF files containing tables, graphs, math, and special characters, often resulting in garbled text"* [Reddit, 2025]

#### #3 **Time-Consuming Manual Editing Required** [MEDIUM IMPACT]
- **"Formatting hell"** - users report spending hours manually fixing converted files [Reddit]
